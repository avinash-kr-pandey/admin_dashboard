# ðŸ“Š Dashboard UI â€“ Static Figma-Based Design

This is a static dashboard project built from a Figma design. It displays graphs, charts, tables, and user-related data, with support for dark and light modes. The dashboard is powered by Vite and designed using React and Tailwind CSS.

## âœ… How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/avinash-kr-pandey/admin_dashboard.git
cd admin_dashboard


2. **Clone the repository:**

npm install

3. **Clone the repository:**

npm run dev


 **Assumptions & Decisions Made**
1. The dashboard is built as a static frontend project based entirely on a Figma design, with no backend or live data integrations.

2. All data (charts, tables, user info, etc.) is mocked or hardcoded to match the UI layout from the design.

3. Vite was chosen over CRA for its faster development speed, simpler configuration, and modern tooling.

4. Tailwind CSS was used for utility-first styling to ensure a responsive and consistent design.

5. Dark and light theme support is implemented using a basic toggle, assuming future enhancement may integrate user preferences or system settings.

6. Component structure and folder organization are designed for scalability, keeping future backend/API integrations in mind.

**Tech Stack Used**
1. React â€“ JavaScript library for building user interfaces

2. Vite â€“ Next-generation frontend tooling

3. Tailwind CSS â€“ Utility-first CSS framework

4. Figma â€“ For UI/UX design reference
